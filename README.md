# About:
In order to run this program, you will need a free API  key from Financial Modeling Prep. 
This program prompts the user to enter a ticker and a number of quarters, and then produces the below graph based on those inputs. I really like to run this for companies to get a big picture view of their financial trajectory and highlight historical turning points in revenue and profitability.

This is inspired by the graph Aswath Damodaran showed at the 9:49 minute mark of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouxmdkMWWmI
